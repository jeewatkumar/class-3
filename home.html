<h2> What is paragraph ?</h2>
A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic .
 Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or 
a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.<br/>
<h2>How do I unify my ideas in a paragraph?</h2>
Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.
Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement,
a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the
thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence 
is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, 
a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or 
topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if 
all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified
if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs
need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which 
serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally don’t have topic sentences.<br/>
